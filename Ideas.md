- To Don't list - a list of things to not do (everybody has already done the to do list, let's mix it up a little bit)

- A map that tracks light pollution, lunar phase and weather at a user selected location - A means to ensure prime conditions for stargazing/low-light photography.

- A visual representation of the spotify library.  A map that users can navigate through with more defined scope at each level.  Spotify API coupled with D3 - more popular genres/songs/artists will be visually represented either by size, color or proximity.  Starting at genre and narrowing down to a specific song at the deepest level. (Genre -> Artist -> Album -> Song)

- An app that tracks Covid cases in a user specified area.  Allows for more specific information the deeper the user navigates.

- An app that tracks your real life travels playing off of the idea of 'fog of war'.  The map starts off greyed out and as the user travels around, visited parts of the map become revealed.  Incentivize exploration and traveling, with perks as more is explored.
